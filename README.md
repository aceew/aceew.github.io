My personal site.

## Why?
I needed some sort of landing page for my name and I thought I'd use this as a chance to start learning webpack, react and other front-end technologies.

## Todo
 - [ ] Use and bundle sass css modules.
 - [ ] Switch out react dev with react production on build.
 - [ ] Blog post feed
 - [ ] Compile css
 - [ ] Force SSL
 - [ ] Build static html from the react components
